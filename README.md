## Project Overview and Goal

This project is COVID-19 Instagram posts emotion detection (anger, fear, joy, and sadness) in relation to images of East Asian people. The basic task is to apply an emotion detection model trained on twitter dataset to instagram posts and examine the relation between emotion and the existence of East Asian people. The bonus task is to build a model for detecting whether there is an Asian person in the instagram posts images.

For a detailed description of the project and results see our [Final Report](COVID-19%20Instagram%20Emotion%20Detection%20-%20Project%20Report.pdf).

## How to Run the Project

**data folder**: 

twitter folder includes 4 files for anger, fear, joy, and sadness emotion classification;

instagram_data.csv/xlsx is the test data for basic emotion detection task
            
images folder includes images data for bonus task
            
processed_instagram_data.csv is the labelled image data
            
**plots folder**: loss-epoch and accuracy-epoch plots for twitter data(training data in emotion detection task)

**classifier.ipynb**: notebook for emotion detection task: classifier notebook in master branch contains the best model we have; we created 'extra-models' branch and included our attempts with other models in the classifier.

**ethnicity_recognition.ipynb**: notebook for ethnicity detection task

**instagram_labels.txt**: a guide provided to understand features in instagram_data.csv/xlsx

**final_instagram_predictions.txt**: classification result based on our best model for emotion detection task. Each line contains the dataset index of the prediction and the emotion.
